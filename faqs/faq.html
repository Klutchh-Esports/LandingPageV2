<h2>4. Scoring System</h2>
      <details>
        <summary>How is the score calculated?</summary>
        <div class="faq__content">
          <p>
            Our scoring system is easy to calculate yet tricky to predict which enhances the fun of Fantasy Esports<br/> <br/>
<ol>
  <li> • We are combining the total of Kills and ACS (Average Combat Score) in Valorant, FP and PP (Finish Points and Placement Points) in PUBGM/BGMI, and Kills and Placement Points in Freefire</li>
  <li> • Your selected multipliers (2x, 1.75x, 1.5x) will make or break your position. Choose wisely.</li>
  <li> • Different contests have a different set of winners</li>
  <li> • If the points for two or more participants turn out to be the same, the prize money will get split equally. For Example- Two Participants end up with the same fantasy points for the 1st Prize Money let’s say Rs 300, both the equal point holders will get Rs 150 each. But such a case is highly unlikely to be repeated on multiple occasions.</li>

            The winner declaration and crediting of the winnings to your Klutchh account usually happens within a couple of hours after the match is completed. Our dedicated team manually verifies the Klutchh Fantasy Scores with our live feed to ensure that the points and scores are correctly updated after every match. This procedure can sometimes take a relatively long time. Only after we are sure that all points and scores are accurate, the final points are updated and winners are declared.

          <p>
            Taxes are deducted at source wherever applicable and paid out by us, as per the Income Tax Act 1961. Thus, if your winnings for a single contest are more than Rs.10,000, a tax of 31.2% will be deducted. The remaining amount (68.80%) will be credited to your winnings balance. E.g. If you win Rs.1,00,000, Rs.31,200 will be deducted and your actual winnings are Rs 68,800. However, you shall be responsible for payment of any other applicable tax, including but not limited to, income tax, gift tax, etc. in respect of the Cash Prizes money won. If you have any queries regarding taxation, we strongly suggest that you consult with a tax expert.
